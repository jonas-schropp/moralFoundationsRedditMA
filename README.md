# moralFoundationsRedditMA

Repository for my master's thesis "Die Moral Foundations Theory im Kontext politischer 
Online-Diskussionsforen Eine Untersuchung zu Gruppendifferenzen und Stabilit√§t intuitiver
moralischer Grundwerte" in psychology at the University of Innsbruck (2019).

At the time of writing my thesis I didn't use Github yet, but I recently stumbled upon 
my old code and thought it would be nicer to have everything somewhat cleaned up and in one place.

This repository contains the thesis itself and the original expose (in the "manuscripts") folder 
as well as the R scripts to calculate the GloVe model on ca. 20 million comments on 
Reddit, calculate Distributed Dictionary Representations for the Moral Foundations Theory, 
and analyze trajectories over time using Mixed Models and lme4. All of the texts are in German.
